# Container, Compose stack and image actions for the Docker Status widget.
# Usage: action.sh <context> <start|stop|restart> <container-id>
#        action.sh <context> <start|stop|restart|down> --project <compose-project>
#        action.sh <context> rmi <image>
# An empty context uses docker's current context. A stack is addressed by its project name only,
# so its compose file doesn't have to be on this machine. "down" removes the stack's containers
# and networks (not its volumes or images); "rmi" deletes an image (a tag, or an untagged image by id).
